# Share-redistributing companies (SRCs)


## Foreword

The documents in this GitHub folder (mostly) describe an idea for a new company model, which I'm calling a Share-Redistributing Company (SRC).

But I'm afraid that these documents might be a little more complicated than what is really needed to describe the idea. So in the following text, I will give an even more concise description of the idea.



## Summary of the idea

In short, an SRC is a company that slowly and continuously redistributes is shares to its costumers.

This happens at regular intervals, which could for instance be at the end of each month.

Then, after each month, the amount of shares that each customer gets is proportional to the money they spent, on products and services, in the same month.

However, although this might make it seem like the redistributed shares are given out for free, this is not the case, since the company will generally raise its prices for its products and services by an amount corresponding to the price of the expected amount of shares the follows with the purchase.

So in effect, an SRC essentially forces its customers to buy out the original shareholders.

Now, being forced to buy shares as a customer might not seem like a benefit, at least not on an individual level. But the point is that other customers are also forced to do the same. And because of this, you know that at some point in the near future (possibly within 20-30 years, depending on the specifics of the SRC), a majority of shares in the company will be held by its customers. And at that point, the majority of the shareholders will no longer have a strong incentive to try to exploit and squeeze the customers for money, since there is no point in squeezing oneself for money.

And SRC is therefore a way for a company to essentially guaranty to its customers that it will not turn exploitative in the future, even if it will lack the competition needed to keep it in check.



## Drawbacks of an SRC

* There will be a bit of added logistics required when it comes to redistributing the shares to the customers. (See more on that below.)

* As an initial shareholder, you can't look forward to exploiting the future costumer base, at least not for very long, since at some point in the near future, a majority of your fellow shareholders will be customers themselves. 


## Benefits of an SRC

* If your customer base is happy at the prospect of knowing that they will not get exploited in the future, the company can potentially attract more customers than it would otherwise. 




## Two types of shares

The initial shareholders of an SRC will be given one class of shares, call it Class A shares. These shares can first of all be traded freely. And at the end of each month (or whatever the interval is), they will decrease by a tiny percentage, and that percentage then goes to creating the new shares that are distributed among the recent customers. And at the same time, the shareholder is then compensated by a return payment, proportional to the share.

And what does it mean that a share decreases? Well, if we imagine that all shares of the SRC are governed digitally, this decrement has a very literal meaning: Then each share is just a floating-point number in a database that describes the total share the the shareholders owns of the company. And at the end of each interval, each share simply has its floating-point number multiplied by a constant factor (close to 100 %), and the difference is distributes out to the recent customers.

Whenever a share is redistributed to a customer, however, it also transforms into another class of shares, Class B. This class of shares is what we can also refer to as the 'customer shares.' They work almost exactly the Class A shares, and are thus also decreased and redistributed continuously themselves (meaning that new customers will also gradually by out old ones, and so on). But unlike the Class A shares, they cannot be traded as freely.

The purpose of this trading restriction on the customer shares is to ensure that it is the customers that ends up buying out the original investors, and not just some other outsiders who buy the shares from the customers, after they have been redistributed to them.

However, the SRC can allow the customers a bit of wriggle room to buy and sell shares, as long as they don't acquire or lose too great an amount of shares this way. And importantly, the SRC can also let the allowed percentage of shares that can be sold by customers increase with age, meaning that older customers will be able to use their amassed customer shares as part of their pension, namely by selling out of their shares.

Furthermore, it should also be possible to transform a Class B share into a Class A share in order to be able to trade it freely, but only at cost proportional to the size of the converted share. When this cost is paid, the value is distributed equally among all the shareholders of the company, maining that all other shares increases with a small amount.

Lastly, if the company / the majority of the shareholders wants, the company can also generate a new batch of Class A shares, letting all other shares in the company decrease with a corresponding amount. These Class A shares can then be sold by the company to new investors, if it e.g. wants to expand, or branch out to new things.
