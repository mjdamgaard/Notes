# Notes

This is a folder where I upload notes about various subjects, such as physics, quantum programming languages, economic proposals, and more. I thus use it similarly to a homepage, in other words. 

I: Mads J. Damgaard, B.Sc. in physics (at the Niels Bohr Insitute) and B.Sc. in computer science (at the UCPH Department of Computer Science).
