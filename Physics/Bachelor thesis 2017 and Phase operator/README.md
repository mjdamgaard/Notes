## My bachelor thesis in physics (2017)

The old website where the thesis was located seems to be down, so I will simply upload the PDF here.

I think there is a lot of spelling mistakes and such in the thesis, and I do not really recommend reading it, since it is much better to just read my two papers on arXiv instead (both derived from it). But since I reference it in both papers, I should make sure that it is available to the public.


## Phase operator paper (2017)
