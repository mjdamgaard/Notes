# QED

## Another update: Version 2 is up

I have just (d. 25.11.22) uploaded the second version of the paper, in which I have removed the claims (which I now know to be wrong) about the resulting theory of QED being different from the conventional one.

I do not plan on continuing this work from here at the moment, but will instead move on to other subjects completely. 

At some point in the future, I will probably return to the subject of QFT and try to read up on how far conventional QFT is from being formulated in a mathematically well-defined way (and look more into whether my work can maybe help or not). But it will probably be a long while until then. 



## Important update!

**Tricked by the Feynman propagator**, it might seem! 

I am a bit embarrassed to admit that I have overlooked a detail in the literature which might mean that the result of this paper actually does match the conventional result exactly after all. 

While working on this project I have mostly been consulting Lancaster and Blundell [5] for reference, and I have seemingly overlooked what the slight difference between Eqs. (39.1) and (39.2) means for the theory (and Sect. 39.3 did not make this clearer for me, unfortunately). But now that I have just reread Chapters 55-58 in Srednicki [6] more carefully, as well as the reference to Weinberg vol. I, it seems that the conventional Feynman propagator of photons actually somewhat subtly cancels the Coulomb interaction! This might therefore very well imply that all the listed implications in Sect. 11 of this paper are wrong: The conventional theory probably does __not__ need an extra Coulomb interaction (since it already might have it, somewhat hidden in the Feynman propagator). 

I will try to check more thoroughly what Feynman diagrams are derived from the Hamiltonian of this paper, and then I will of course update the paper once I have checked these results.



## Future work

Task 1 and 2: Showing that a domain exists on which the Hamiltonian is self-adjoint and then showing that its propagator can be approximated with bounded and discretized generators. 

Task 3: Showing Lorentz covariance.

Task 4: Showing that pure states transform into pure states. (This task is not very important, but it might be interesting for some.)

Task 5: Completing a Dirac sea reinterpretation and showing Lorentz covariance for the resulting theory.
