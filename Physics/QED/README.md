# Future work

Task 1 and 2: Showing that a domain exists on which the Hamiltonian is self-adjoint and then showing that its propagator can be approximated with bounded and discretized generators. 

Task 3: Showing Lorentz covariance.

Task 4: Showing that pure states transform into pure states. (This task is not very important, but it might be interesting for some.)

Task 5: Completing a Dirac sea reinterpretation and showing Lorentz covariance for the resulting theory.
