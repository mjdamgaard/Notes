# QED

In my QED paper of 2022, I left some tasks for "future work." These tasks were:

* Task 1: Showing that a domain exists on which the Hamiltonian is self-adjoint.

* Task 2: Showing that its propagator can be approximated with bounded and discretized generators.

* Task 3: Showing Lorentz covariance.

* Task 4: Showing that pure states transform into pure states. (This task is not very important, but it might be interesting for some.)

* Task 5: Completing a Dirac sea reinterpretation and showing Lorentz covariance for the resulting theory.

I have just (d. 12.11.23 in the moment of writing) submitted a paper on the self-adjointness of a simplified Dirac interaction operator.
And the hope is that this result can be extended to the full Dirac Hamiltonian (and a wide range of other opertors).
So completing Task 1 might be feasable.

I believe I have also solved Task 2. I believe one just needs to make a certain cutoff, where all of the "matrix elements" of the Hamiltonian
is multiplied by an exponential decreasing function of the sum of all the outgoing momenta squared
and divided by the same function of all the incoming momenta squared.
One should then be able to argue that the $\varepsilon$-almost eigenstates of this cut-off Hamiltonian should converge to those of the original one
(provided that the latter is shown to be self-adjoint). And this should solve Task 2, making us able to derive the path integral formulation of the theory.
*\[(23.11.23) No, that cutoff does not work after all, so I still need to solve this task.:\\\]

Task 3 and 4 deals with showing the Lorentz covariance of the theory, which is not quite as important for me now that I have realized
that the theory that I derived in my 2022 paper is equivalent to the conventional theory. (I thought the conventional theory did not contain a Coulomb potential.)
But they would still be nice to complete at some point. In my qed.tex document, which can currently be found in my backup folder, I believe I have worked out how to
solve these Tasks. (Task 4 is very easy but Task 3, on the other hand, is quite complicated (at least unless my cutoff for Task 2 can also help here...).)
But I will probably not resume this work in the near future myself, at least not before the other tasks are already dealt with.

Now, Task 5 is were the really interesting stuff lies. I included a small note on how to solve this problem in Appendix C of the self-adjointness paper,
that I have just (in the moment of writing) submitted. I should elaborate some more on this idea, and in fact, I believe that this idea absolutely deserves its
own paper, which I will start working on in the near future. (And I also intend to eleborate on my solution for Task 2 in this paper.)

I do, however, also want to get back and work on my 'Semantic Database' project, which I have obviously neglected while writing my self-adjointness paper
in the past two months (from mid september to mid november). So I will probably focus on that project for a little while.
But I do certainly look forward to coming back and working more on this again, especially on Task 5: Not only is it increadibly exciting theoretically, but the way I see it,
there is even a chance that it could lead to slightly altered predictions! (Becasue it might tell us that we need to cut away all pair productions.) 

(All my ideas here are also described (poorly, of course) in my working notes found in qed.tex and 23-xx note collection.tex, but I do not really expect anyone to read those.)

Feel free to email me if you have any questions about my work.
