# QED

In my QED paper of 2022, I left some tasks for "future work." These tasks were:

* Task 1: Showing that a domain exists on which the Hamiltonian is self-adjoint.

* Task 2: Showing that its propagator can be approximated with bounded and discretized generators.

* Task 3: Showing Lorentz covariance.

* Task 4: Showing that pure states transform into pure states. (This task is not very important, but it might be interesting for some.)

* Task 5: Completing a Dirac sea reinterpretation and showing Lorentz covariance for the resulting theory.

I have just (d. 12.11.23 in the moment of writing) submitted a paper on the self-adjointness of a simplified Dirac interaction operator.
And the hope is that this result can be extended to the full Dirac Hamiltonian (and a wide range of other opertors).
So completing Task 1 might be feasable.


I think I have a way to solve Task 2 now, and I have just (d. 05.12.23 in the moment of editing) submitted a paper to arXiv about my solution
to Task 5 below, in which I also describe this possible solution for Task 2.

Let me just mention here that if one could show that all $\varepsilon$-almost eigenstates decreases faster than a certain polynomial
w.r.t. both photon number and momentum, then it seems that it be easy to show. But I am not very optimistic about this approach, though.

Task 3 and 4 deals with showing the Lorentz covariance of the theory, which is not quite as important for me now that I have realized
that the theory that I derived in my 2022 paper is equivalent to the conventional theory. (I thought the conventional theory did not contain a Coulomb potential.)
But they would still be nice to complete at some point. In my 'qed.tex' document, which can currently be found in my backup folder, I believe I have worked out how to
solve these Tasks. (Task 4 is very easy but Task 3, on the other hand, is quite complicated.)
But I will probably not resume this work in the near future myself, at least not before the other tasks are already dealt with.

Now, Task 5 is were the really interesting stuff lies: Not only are its potential prospects increadibly exciting on a pure theoretical level, but the way I see it,
there is even a chance that it could lead to slightly altered experimental predictions! (Becasue it might tell us that we need to cut away all pair productions.)
I included a small note on how to solve this problem in Appendix C of the self-adjointness paper.

I have just (d. 23.11.23 in the moment of editing) submitted a paper to arXiv about my solution to Task 5!

(18.12.23) In my updated vacuum paper that I submitted this saturday, there is an assumption about the existence of a sequence of eigenvectors that converges to a
generalized eigenvecor of H_{vac}''', \ket{\phi}. In terms of showing this, if one can simply show that there are generalized eigenvectors whose formula is continous
with respect to the momentum vectors (at least somewhere!), then one can make a simple proof from there considering the \epsilon-almost eigenstates of both H_{vac}'''
and H_{vac}''. At least, I am pretty sure that this is so. And in terms of proving the first part, I mean, that must be so, at least *somewhere*...

And even if my arguments here does not hold, I know that there is existing technology for showing the existence of an eigenstate (I have gethered this from reading
F. Hiroshima), so I'm not worried at all that this will turn out to be a hard task; I really don't think it will.

And now I will finally start looking more into whether my proposed Hamiltonian of QED will really lead to different path integrals, as I think it might!

(d. 13.12.23) I brushed a bit up on QFT, and of course my discovery here will very likely lead to different experimental predictions. By the way, what a great
coincidence that some researchers are actually building and preparing for an experiemnt right now to measure the vacuum! Maybe they will end up confirming my
theory/theoretical result here, who knows?!..

I will, however, also want to get back and work on my 'Semantic Database' project, which I have obviously neglected while writing my self-adjointness paper
in the past two months (from mid september to mid november). So I will probably focus on that project for a little while.
But I do certainly look forward to coming back and working more on this again, especially on Task 5: Not only is it increadibly exciting theoretically, but the way I see it,
there is even a chance that it could lead to slightly altered predictions! (Becasue it might tell us that we need to cut away all pair productions.)


(All my ideas here are also described (poorly, of course) in my working notes found in 'qed.tex' and '23-xx note collection.tex', but I do not really expect anyone to read those.)
-->

(20.03.24) I have found some problems with my vacuum paper, and now I actually have more hopes for a different idea, where one does the Dirac sea reinterpretation
via a countable basis. This idea is described in '23-xx note collection.tex' found in the 'backup' folder. I will also make some corrections to my vacuum paper on arXiv
at some point, but since no one reads it currently anyway, and since I'm quite exhausted now from working a lot on this problem, I might very well delay this update
for a while.
