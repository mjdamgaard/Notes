# Hiq

I might have come up with a good name for this high-level quantum programming language now.

I think I will call it: Hiq.

Here, 'Hi' stands for high-level and 'q' stands for quantum (programming language).

My bachelor's thesis in computer science (see the PDF) detail it. 

It might be a good idea to skip the type checking rules on the first readthrough. But these rules do, however, explain some important details, if one were to implement the language. 

The rules are to be understood basically as a kind of logic programming paradigm pseudocode, where propositions can also carry along some mathematical object as part of the proposition. These objects are e.g. changes to the typing environment, or sets of variables that the gates cannot work on (which is important since a central point of the language is to catch any physically impossible quantum algorithm in the preprocessing of the programs). 

The rules should be explained in the thesis, but feel free to e-mail me any questions at fxn318@alumni.ku.dk if something in the report is unclear.
